This is the repository for the second project as a part of my studies as a data science project

In this repository I have 4 notebooks
1. In this notebook I tried to get a better result on the classification notebook from mt first semester, using new tools i have aquired such has ensemble learning and dimensionality reduction
2. In the second notebook I was given the mission to try and get the highest accuracy on the Fashion-Mnist Data set without using neural networks
3. The third notebook is simillar to the second one, only in this one I worked on the cats-vs-dogs data set
4. In the fourth notebook i had to create a classifier to classify hand movement, were they when the person was alone, when he tried to sync with the second person, or when he tries to be spontaneous
